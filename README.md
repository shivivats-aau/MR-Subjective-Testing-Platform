# MR-Subjective-Testing-Platform
A Platform for Subjective Quality Assessment in Mixed Reality Environments. The related paper will be linked/cited when published.

This repository is incomplete right now. Only the "point cloud preview" feature works and only with the [8i Voxelized Full Bodies Dataset](http://plenodb.jpeg.org/pc/8ilabs/).

Please place the PLY files from the dataset in the `Assets/Resources/PointClouds` folder. The files must be in binary format and contain the demuxed data of desired point cloud qualities.

The project has been tested with Unity version 2021.3.19f1. Please install that version of the Unity editor to make sure the project works fully.

### Improvements will be made to the code very soon. Initial code is presented for now.
